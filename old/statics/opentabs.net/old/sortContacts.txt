user stories (in order of decreasing importance):
-------------------------------------------------
1 - quickly send an IOU to someone who's likely to be physically near, but might not have checked in, and might not even be registered. Start typing user address, it fills in. then a dialog with amount, currency, description.
2 - receive a notification that requires an action: it shows at the top, also triggers a desktop/phone notif if the apps's not in focus.
3 - find a specific tab you know exists, and mark it as paid:sub-story of 6. it's natural to see a per-peer overview before settling anything. there should also be a natural way to receive partial or over-payment, so if you have the per-peer overview open, it should probably say 'settle' and then 'I paid' or 'I received', and these should show up in the history as payments, not IOUs. but if you mark one entire IOU as paid, then maybe a payment entry should go into history and they should have a link to each other. 'Settled their <17 Oct> tab'
4 - see an overview of your situation: per currency, peer-totals, red to green. click on peer-total to list history of description -> amount.
5 - find a specific tab you know exists, and request payment.
6 - check whether you're cool with a specific peer: the 'open new tab' list also displays a per-peer totals summary. click on it to see bigger, complete, per-peer-per-currency totals, with a description->amount+currency list hanging from it.

see http://opentabs.net/mainMenu.html and http://opentabs.net/mainMenuWNotif.html

clicking on a name should open /both/ the new tab dialog and the per-peer list.


09:09 < JanCBorchardt> history should not be a separated view but collapsed by 
              default
09:10 < JanCBorchardt> exactly, no "tabs" ;)
09:10 < JanCBorchardt> and yeah, images, profile images, that would be awesome
09:10 < JanCBorchardt> a photo, the "user" part of the user address, a (+) and 
                     the total balance
09:10 < JanCBorchardt> that is a row of the user
09:10 < JanCBorchardt> and it needs to be a table, not a list
09:10 < michielbdejong_> can you mock that up in html?
09:11 < michielbdejong_> or you have a scanner there?
09:11 < michielbdejong_> we are now already so far advanced that we need new 
                      wire frames, i would say
09:12 < JanCBorchardt> <tr id="mich@unhosted.org"><td (click this to add a new 
                     tab)>photo Name</td><td (click this to expand 
                    all)>Total</td></tr>
09:12 < michielbdejong_> or let me mock it up, and then you can comment on it
09:12 < JanCBorchardt> no, this line
09:12 < JanCBorchardt> is one contact
09:12 < JanCBorchardt> and then, each transaction:
09:13 < JanCBorchardt> <tr id="[transactionID]"><td>Reason</td><td (this gets 
                   colored)>Amount Currency</td></tr>
09:13 < JanCBorchardt> and when clicking the row, the buttons "mark as paid" or 
                  else appear
09:13 < JanCBorchardt> bbl


at the top: importants, one-by-one.
then: a box with contacts who are close (if any)
then: other contact avatars with at least one open tab, 4 columns.
then: all other contacts
then: ellipsis.
